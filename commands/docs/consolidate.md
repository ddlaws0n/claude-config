Use the doc-specialist subagent to consolidate and optimize project documentation. Survey all documentation files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, AGENTS.md, docs/ directory), identify issues (duplicated information, outdated content, misplaced documentation, coverage gaps, poor organization), create a consolidation plan, execute the consolidation by merging duplicates and improving organization, and provide a detailed report with rationale and suggestions.

Focus on creating a clean, DRY, well-organized documentation structure that's easy to navigate and maintain.
