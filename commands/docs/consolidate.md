agent: doc-specialist

Consolidate and optimize project documentation. Use the doc-specialist to:

1. Survey all documentation files in the project:
   - CLAUDE.md
   - README.md
   - AGENTS.md
   - docs/ directory
   - Any other documentation

2. Identify issues:
   - Duplicated information
   - Outdated or conflicting content
   - Misplaced documentation
   - Coverage gaps
   - Poor organization

3. Create a consolidation plan:
   - What to merge
   - What to move
   - What to delete
   - How to reorganize

4. Execute the consolidation:
   - Merge duplicates into single source of truth
   - Move docs to appropriate locations
   - Remove redundant/outdated content
   - Add cross-references and navigation
   - Improve overall organization

5. Provide a detailed report:
   - Summary of changes made
   - Rationale for decisions
   - Remaining issues or gaps
   - Ongoing maintenance suggestions

Focus on creating a clean, DRY, well-organized documentation structure that's easy to navigate and maintain.
